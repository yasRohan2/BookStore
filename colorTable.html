                India’s geography and climate is incredibly diverse. Northern India is characterised by the snowy
                mountain range of the Himalayas and the Great Indian (Thar) Desert. Meanwhile, tropical jungles,
                rainforests, coastal plains, islands and beaches distinguish the south. Nature plays a vital role in
                India – especially rivers such as the Ganga (or ‘Ganges’) in the north and Godavari in the central and
                southeast. Both provide irrigation for farmlands, a method of transportation and are considered sacred
                to many followers of Hinduism.</p>



               <p> As India has one of the largest populations in the world, public and private spaces are often densely
                populated. This influences how the idea of privacy is understood, as it is rarely available, sought
                after or indulged in. Generally, there is a very large cultural tolerance for crowding. For example,
                several generations often live under one roof, and it is not uncommon to find animals such as cows or
                dogs freely roaming public streets and villages.
